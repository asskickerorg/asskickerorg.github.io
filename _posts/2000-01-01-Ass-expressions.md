I have a good number of friends who are not native English speakers. After a while I became aware of the prevalence of phrases involving the word "ass" and their importance in everyday communication. If you are already an accomplished speaker of English then you can bet your ass that you already know these words. Your friends would kick your ass if you didn't. Indeed, you'd be an asswipe.

There are two basic definitions of "ass": (1) A donkey or (2) that part of your anatomy between your lower back and upper legs. Few of the following definitions involve the donkey definition; still others have no obvious metaphorical connection to either.

## Let's start with a couple generative formations

__[adjective] + ass__: "Ass" can be used simply to indicate emphasis. "Strong ass medicine", "Mean ass dog", "Starving ass college student" are equivalent to "Very strong medicine", "Very mean dog", "Average college student".

__[verb] your ass off__: As in "work your ass off" or "laugh your ass off".  To perform the activity to excess.  "I thought that Bob was funny but I really laughed my ass off when Ann started telling jokes." (Thanks to Beau Rostama for this one)

__[verb] my ass__:  Refers to yourself overall; a substitute for just "me"  "My boss has been hounding my ass all day" (meaning that your boss has been scrutinizing you, see below.  Equivalent to "My boss has been hounding me all day".).  Often [to be] my ass; also [riding] my ass, [hounding] my ass.  (Thanks to Clay H for this one).

## Then on to the normal expressions

__Ass backwards__: (also Bass ackwards, back-asswards) To do something in the wrong order, or wrong direction. "She's got that part installed ass-backwards."

__Assclown__: Fool.  Also see the [UrbanDictionary definitions](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=assclown). (Thanks to J. Clayton Wine and Clay H for this one).  Also:  assface, asshead.  It's not clear that any of these have any clear meaning except to be an insult (compare with "asshole", which does have a distinct meaning and is also an insult).

__Ass crack of dawn__: Extremely early in the morning.  "We have to get up and go at the ass crack of dawn or we'll never make our flight." (Thanks to Dr. Ami for this one).

__Ass in a sling__: To be in trouble. "I've got to go home now or my wife will have my ass in a sling".

__Ass is grass__: In big trouble. "Bob, if you screw up one more time your ass is grass".

__Ass man__: Guy who judges women by their butts. Compare with "Boob man" and "leg man". "Bob is an ass man, but me, I'm a boob man".

__Ass on the line__: responsible for an action or decision. "I am concerned about the presentation because my ass is on the line".

__Ass whuppin__: A physical beating.

__Asshole__: An unpleasant person.

__Assholes and elbows__:  This is a phrase used in construction to mean I want to see everyone working really hard. It conjures up an image of everyone bent over working and all you can see is their rear ends and their elbows.  As quoted from the movie Aliens:  "Allright, sweethearts, you heard the man and you know the drill! Assholes and elbows!"  (Thanks to Alice for this one)

__Asswipe__: Useless person. "Bob is such an asswipe; he can't even tie his shoes".

__Drag ass__: To go slowly because you've got no energy. "I was dragging ass after that big bike ride". It has been suggested that I made this one up, and a cursory search on Google would seem to indicate it's not in active use, but I assure you that my friends and I actually use it. That's just how cool we are.  See, if you had a web page like this one, you could put your own pet phrases on it even if Google doesn't agree.  Sorta makes it all worthwhile, eh?
