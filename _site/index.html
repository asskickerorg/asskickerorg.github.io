<p>I have a good number of friends who are not native English speakers. After a while I became aware of the prevalence of phrases involving the word “ass” and their importance in everyday communication. If you are already an accomplished speaker of English then you can bet your ass that you already know these words. Your friends would kick your ass if you didn’t. Indeed, you’d be an asswipe.</p>

<p>There are two basic definitions of “ass”: (1) A donkey or (2) that part of your anatomy between your lower back and upper legs. Few of the following definitions involve the donkey definition; still others have no obvious metaphorical connection to either.</p>

<h2 id="lets-start-with-a-couple-generative-formations">Let’s start with a couple generative formations</h2>
